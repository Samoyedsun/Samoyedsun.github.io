Hi, I'm John. I had an interesting vacation.

I went to America with my friends in the April of this year.

I first took a subway to make a lot of money with my friend Chow Yun Fat in Las Vegas on April twelfth.

And I bought a sports car and drove the car to go to the Grand Canyon with my friend Obama on April thirteenth. We felt very excited.

Then I saw the Statue of Liberty with my best friend Angelababy and then I flied my friend Jackie Chan's private plane to go to the Eiffel Tower on April fourteenth.

I think this vacation was amazing and very crazy.

But I forgot to carry my camera, so I couldn't share photos with you. That's too bad.
